# What I choose(Block 4)
# EXTENDING THE CODON TABLE, I choose it.

# Why I choose it
If I truly say the truth then, I choose it because choosing this one decision was easy to implement , 
choosing to extend the coodn table help me to analyze more about the functions I created in that alredy exist function, 
also right now I don't want to write new code I just want to improve my this code and my understanding by analysizing different codon and the result it gives.
I want to go deeper in this function for knowing that if each frame give me the same output or it chnges in every frame. Becuase every frame is reading differently so it forms different codon in every frame . Every time after entering RNA sequence it shows me 3 different frames with different codoons and every frame gives different output as showing amino acid from codon table.
Also by extending codon table I can see more amino acid formation in differnt frames. Currently thhis is only giving correct or best output in frame 1 but by adding more coodn in codon table I am sure it will show output in other two frames as well as efficiently.

# What biological meaning it has 
Extending codon table show output by of different codon forms in 3 differnt frames going through codon table.

# What limitation still exist 
It still exists limitations such as Codon table is now not fully completed. A lot of codon addition in codon table is required to put in it to improve result much better.
It has lefted to show any symbol specifying that this codon code for that amino acid.
