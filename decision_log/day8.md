# Which mutation had the most impact and why
Point mutation had the most impact. Because in point mutation, there is insertion or deletion of single nucleotide in DNA or its RNA transcript, changes reading frame of nucleotides sequence or codon. Change in codon leads to translation of non-functional amino acid in protein. This mutation in sequence change in phenotype as well as in genotype which makes different from wild type which is more common.
For example:- Without mutation:-  DNA sequence(3' TACTTGACCATC 5') during transcription form mRNA sequence (5' AUGAACUGGUAG 3'). And this sequence is in correct order of Open reading frame and this will translate amino acid sequence AUG act as strat codon which signals robosome to intiate translation, AAC code for Asn(N), UGG code for Trp(W), UAG is stop codon which stops the process.
With mutation:-  DNA sequence(3' TACTTGACCATC 5') after transcription becomes mRNA sequence (5' AUGUAACUGGUAG 3') is mutated during transcription due to insertion of "U" nucleotide in mRNA sequence at 4th position. Insertion of a single nucleotides shifts the reading frame. 
This sequence generates NO amino acid beacuse in this mutated sequence AUG is start codon, next codon UAA codes for termination stops the translation process and no amino acid form from this sequence.
Just a single insertion or a point mutation in nucleotide sequence leads to no amino acid formation. And due to this no formation of protein complicate further process, within orginism.

# Why ORF length matters biologically 
ORF length matters biologically because it form accurate protein. If ORF length gets disturb due to mutation it will can't be able to generate amino acid for protein formation for a particulary function to perform.

# One limitation of my code 
My codes has many limition right now, but if I say just one major limititation than it is my codes are just working on the functions I wrote as code according to my knowledge till now, it's jsut giving output on that basis. My codes still functions on basis of my knowledge. It doen't have any database or any real world dataset to perform function on it and give exact and exciting outputs.
